main_1, simple configuration.
    * show how to add dependency. 
    * add common Java Type to graphql.

    ```
        query {
            getAuthors {
            id
            firstName
            lastName
        }
    }
    ```        
main_2, graphql field
    * parameterized graphql field.

    ```
          fragment bookFragment on Book {
            isdn
            title
          }
        fragment authorFragment on Author {
            firstName
            lastName
        }
    
        query {
            getAuthors {
                ... authorFragment
                books   {
                    ... bookFragment
                    authors {
                        ... authorFragment
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ```
    
main_2_mutation, mutation. without validation. should add during the demo

    ```
        mutation {
          save(author: {
            firstName: "ben"
          
          }) {
            id
          }
        }
    ```

main_3 graphql security. 
    how to put pre-authorized. depth query, how many fields it can project..
    GraphqlSecurityIT.
    disable schema introspective.
    disable any server side hosting of the Altair/graphiql etc.
    disable any exception trace. (don't let client know what language your app/libraries is running)
    disable any spring trace. (don't display spring favicon spring whitelabel error etc.....)
    limited what queries you supports. (query only by queryOperatorName etc).
    rate limiting.
    obfuscated query. each query can only query once. (include time-based check in the query)
    encode your query with some sort of encoding schema and decoding at the interceptor. (twitter/X approach).
    uglify and minified client code. make it harder to reverse engineer the encoding/decoding scheme and time based query parameter
